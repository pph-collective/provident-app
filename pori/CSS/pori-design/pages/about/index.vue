        <p>In 2014, over 240 Rhode Islanders lost their lives to overdose — that’s more than the number of people who died in car accidents, murders, and suicides combined. In 2016, more than 300 Rhode Islanders lost their lives to overdose. To respond to this public health crisis, Rhode Island has developed a strategic plan to address the epidemic. Building on past accomplishments and progress of the original plan 2019, the strategic plan was updated in 2019.</p>
