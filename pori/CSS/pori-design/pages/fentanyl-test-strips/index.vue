        <div class="secondary-left">
          <p>A deadly opioid called fentanyl is being added to drugs and it can cause you to overdose quickly.</p>
          <p>Fentanyl test strips are easy to use tests to see if your drugs have been mixed with fentanyl. When you get your result, you can make the decision about what to do next.</p>

          <h2>What can I do?</h2>
          <h5>I can learn how to use them</h5>
          <ul class="instructions-steps">
            <li><strong>If you are injecting,</strong>  first prepare your shot. Next, add ten drops of water to your cooker and stir well.</li>
            <li><strong>If you are snorting</strong> your drugs, add ten drops of water into the empty baggie that your drugs came in and mix well.</li>
            <li><strong>If you are using pills,</strong> you can crush one in an empty baggie and then dump out the powder. Then add ten drops of water into the baggie and mix well.</li>
            <li><strong>Dip your fentanyl test strip into the water up to the wavy lines</strong> and wait fifteen seconds and then take it out.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>I can learn how to read my results</h5>
          <ul class="instructions-steps">
            <li>Results usually take about one or two minutes to show up.</li>
            <li><strong>If you see only one red line in the middle of the test, it means that your drugs have fentanyl in them.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>If you see two lines in the middle of the test, it means that the test strip is negative.</strong> The second line could be very faint, but that still means it is negative.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>I can take action to avoid an overdose</h5>
          <ul class="instructions-steps">
            <li>If you have a positive test it is important to have naloxone with you and to use with someone who isn’t using at the same time as you. If you overdose, they can call 911 and give you naloxone. Learn how you can be safer when you use drugs.</li>
            <li>If you have a negative test you still need to be careful. Your drugs may still be mixed with fentanyl or mixed with something else that the strips cannot find. Learn about safer drug use.</li>
            <li>Go Slow! Start by using a little bit and wait for 20 seconds to see how strong it is. If it feels off, be careful — consider not using it or taking less. Be sure someone with you has naloxone.</li>
          </ul>
